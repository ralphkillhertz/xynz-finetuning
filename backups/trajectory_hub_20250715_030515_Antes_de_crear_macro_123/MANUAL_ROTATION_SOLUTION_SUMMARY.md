# Manual Rotation MS - Solution Summary

## Changes Implemented:

### 1. UI Controller (`interactive_controller.py`):
- ✅ Removed interpolation speed input for manual rotation
- ✅ Added `instant: True` flag to rotation parameters

### 2. Command Processor (`command_processor.py`):
- ✅ Detects `instant` flag and sets `interpolation_speed = 1000.0` for instant rotation

### 3. Motion Components (`motion_components.py`):
- ✅ Modified ManualMacroRotation to only change orientation, not position
- ✅ Added `rotation_completed` flag to stop after applying
- ✅ Changed `calculate_delta` to set `delta.orientation` instead of `delta.position`
- ✅ Updated `update` method to only modify `state.orientation`

## Current Behavior:

### What Works:
- ✅ Manual rotation no longer asks for interpolation speed
- ✅ Position remains unchanged (no movement)
- ✅ Rotation applies once and stops (no continuous rotation)
- ✅ Can apply multiple manual rotations

### What Needs Integration:
- The orientation values are being set in the MotionState
- These need to be sent to Spat via OSC using `send_source_orientation()`
- The OSC bridge already has the methods to send orientation

## How Manual Rotation MS Now Works:

1. User selects "Rotación Manual de Macro"
2. Enters Yaw, Pitch, Roll values (in degrees)
3. System converts to radians and applies instantly
4. Only `state.orientation` is updated (not position)
5. After one update, the component disables itself
6. Macro stays in the exact same position with new orientation

## Key Differences from Before:
- **Before**: Treated as position transformation (rotating objects around a center)
- **Now**: Only orientation change (how the object is facing)

## Integration Needed:
The orientation values need to be sent to Spat. In the engine's update loop, after updating motion states, it should:
```python
# Send orientations to Spat
for source_id, motion_state in self.motion_states.items():
    if hasattr(motion_state.state, 'orientation'):
        self.osc_bridge.send_source_orientation(
            source_id + 1,  # Spat uses 1-based indexing
            np.degrees(motion_state.state.orientation[0]),  # Yaw
            np.degrees(motion_state.state.orientation[1]),  # Pitch
            np.degrees(motion_state.state.orientation[2])   # Roll
        )
```
