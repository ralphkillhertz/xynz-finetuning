# Manual Rotation Fix Summary

## Changes Made:

1. **UI Controller** (interactive_controller.py line 602):
   - Removed the interpolation speed input for manual rotation
   - Added `"instant": True` flag to the rotation parameters

2. **Command Processor** (command_processor.py line 170-181):
   - Added handling for the `instant` flag
   - When instant=True, sets interpolation_speed to 1000.0

3. **Motion Components** (motion_components.py line 1127-1138):
   - Added check for interpolation_speed >= 100.0
   - If true, rotation is applied instantly without interpolation

## How it works now:

### Manual Rotation MS:
- No longer asks for interpolation speed
- Is instantaneous by default
- Just sets the macro to a specific orientation (pitch, yaw, roll)

### Behavior with Algorithmic Rotation:
- Manual rotation can temporarily override position
- Algorithmic rotation continues after manual adjustment
- Both can coexist

## Usage:
1. Select "Rotaci√≥n Manual de Macro" from menu
2. Enter desired angles (Yaw, Pitch, Roll in degrees)
3. Rotation is applied instantly

## Technical Details:
- Instant rotation uses interpolation_speed = 1000.0
- This triggers the instant path in ManualMacroRotation.calculate_delta()
- Current angles are immediately set to target angles
